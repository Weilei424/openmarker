### Phase 4 — Manual editing ✓ (later REMOVED in Phase 5 optimization round)
> All of the items below shipped during Phase 4 but were removed in the Phase 5
> optimization round in favour of an engine-driven, read-only workflow. See
> "Phase 5 (optimization round)" below for the removal commits.
- [x] Drag pieces on canvas
- [x] Rotate pieces (R key + handle)
- [x] Snap behavior (10 mm grid drag-end; 1° rotation drag-end)
- [x] Collision highlight feedback (piece-to-piece SAT + out-of-bounds)
- [x] Placement state model (usePlacements hook: pieceId → x, y, rotationDeg)
- [x] Regression tests for drag/rotate transformations
- [x] Auto fit-to-content on import
- [x] Auto fabric width on import (computed from initial row layout)
- [x] Dynamic rotation handle distance (always outside piece bbox)
- [x] Smooth rotation via direct Konva mutation (no React re-renders during drag)
- [x] CJK encoding detection in DXF parser (GBK / Big5 fallback)

### Pre-Phase 5 Fixes ✓
- [x] Parse `Quantity: N` from TEXT entities in each DXF block; emit N copies of the piece
- [x] Name duplicated pieces `{name} (1)`, `{name} (2)` … when quantity > 1
- [x] Y-axis flip in `normalize_piece()` (DXF Y-up → canvas Y-down)
- [x] Parse `LINE` on layer 7 in each DXF block as grainline; store start/end in `RawPiece`
- [x] Apply Y-flip + origin translate to grainline coords in `normalize_piece()`
- [x] Add `grainline_direction_deg: float | None` to `Piece` model and engine.ts type
- [x] Update/add tests: quantity expansion, Y-flip orientation, grainline parsing, 2×2 fixture
- [x] Cap max zoom to 500% (MAX_SCALE = 5) to prevent stroke-artifact confusion

### Phase 5 — Simple auto layout
- [x] User inputs fabric width
- [x] Run placement heuristic (NFP-based Bottom-Left-Fill via pyclipper + Shapely)
- [x] Compute marker length (max Y bottom edge of placed pieces + edge gap)
- [x] Compute utilization percentage (clamped to 100% with overflow warning)
- [x] Multi-strategy sort (area / max-dim / height / width DESC); best wins
- [x] Grain mode (none / single / bi) with fabric grain fixed at 90°
- [x] Fast mode (bbox shelf-pack) vs accurate mode (polygon NFP-BLF)
- [x] Copies (1–20) with per-set color palette (no black/white/yellow)
- [x] Manual-edit toggle (off by default); R-key + drag + rotation handle gated
- [x] Stop button — engine cancellation flag + /cancel-layout endpoint + run_in_threadpool
- [x] Live metrics panel + dotted marker-length line on canvas
- [x] Fabric/piece grain arrows when grain mode != none

### Phase 5 (optimization round) — UX redesign & remaining bugs ✓
See `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-18-phase5-auto-layout-optimization.md`.
- [x] Top preview panel — always-visible horizontal strip of imported pieces with names (outline-only thumbnails, no fill)
- [x] Don't render pieces on canvas until auto-layout completes (no initial single-row preview)
- [x] Rotate canvas 90° CCW (fabric extends right; grain arrow points right; marker-length line vertical)
- [x] Selection by click works without enabling editing; re-click / empty-stage click deselects
- [x] Engine overlap eps raised from 1e-3 → 0.5 mm² to match frontend SAT tolerance
- [x] **Removed** frontend collision detection (`useCollisions`, `collisions.ts`, `geometry.ts` + tests) — engine is now authoritative for placement validity
- [x] **Removed** manual editing entirely (drag, rotate handle, R-key, "Enable manual edit on canvas" checkbox, `updatePlacement`) — too risky to maintain alongside engine-driven layout
- [x] Fabric width default = 1500 mm, resets on each import (no auto-fit to pieces)
- [x] Bi-direction never worse than single-direction — engine runs both modes when bi is selected and keeps the shorter result
- [x] Topbar shows current import filename ("OpenMarker — Working on sample_1.dxf")

### Phase 6 — Fixes, performance, and UI improvements

User-visible scope (raw requirements captured from planning conversation):

1. **UI — dynamic window size.** Default window starts at 70% of the monitor *height* with a 4:3 aspect ratio (width = height × 4 / 3), regardless of monitor resolution. Replace the current fixed 1280×800 default in `desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.
2. **UI — copies input height.** Double the height of the Settings → Copies number input. Currently too short to read comfortably.
3. **Feature — remove grain mode "none" (free).** Drop the "none" option from `GrainPanel` and from engine `grain.allowed_rotations()`. Only `single` and `bi` remain. Default = `single`.
4. **Feature — remove fast mode (bbox).** Drop the "Fast mode" toggle and `auto_layout_bbox` code path. Only the polygon NFP-BLF path (`auto_layout_polygon`) remains.
5. **Feature — show/hide grainline toggle.** Add a checkbox (likely in `GrainPanel` or new view-options area) that toggles rendering of the yellow grainline arrows on pieces. Default = visible.
6. **Feature — auto-layout result cache.** In-memory cache (engine side) keyed by `filename + timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS)` + settings `{grain_mode (single|bi), copies}`. Max 5 entries (FIFO eviction). Identical request returns the cached result instead of re-running the heuristic.
7. **Feature — cache feeds future export.** Cached entries store the full layout result (placements + metrics) so that the Phase 7 export flow can pick any cached tab to export, not just the current one.
8. **UI — metrics moved to bottom panel + timer.** Remove the live metrics block from the left sidebar. Add a new bottom panel showing: marker length, utilization %, overflow warning, and a layout-duration timer in `MM:SS` format (measured from auto-layout request → response).
9. **Feature — per-tab cached metrics.** Each cached-result tab keeps its own metrics (marker length, utilization, duration). Switching tabs swaps both the canvas placements and the bottom-panel metrics.

Task checklist:

**Original Phase 6 plan:**
- [x] Engine: `LayoutCache` module (FIFO, max 5, no dedup)
- [x] Engine: wire cache into `POST /auto-layout` (returns id/timestamp/duration)
- [x] Engine: `GET /layouts`, `GET /layouts/{id}`, `DELETE /layouts/{id}`, `DELETE /layouts`
- [x] Engine: drop `'none'` grain mode
- [x] Engine: drop `auto_layout_bbox` (fast mode)
- [x] Engine: require `filename`, reject `grain_mode='none'` (422)
- [x] Frontend: tighten `GrainMode` type, add `CachedLayout` types
- [x] Frontend: `useLayoutCache` hook
- [x] Frontend: `useAutoLayout` sends filename + copies; drops fast_mode
- [x] Frontend: `usePlacements` derives from active cached entry
- [x] Frontend: `GrainPanel` drops none + fast, adds Show grainline
- [x] Frontend: `PieceShape` uses `showGrainline` prop
- [x] Frontend: `CanvasWorkspace` passes `showGrainline`
- [x] Frontend: `BottomPanel` with `MM:SS` timer
- [x] Frontend: `CachedLayoutTabs` strip above canvas
- [x] Frontend: App.tsx new layout; double-height copies input
- [x] Frontend: delete unused `utils/metrics.ts`
- [x] Desktop: drop fixed window size, start hidden
- [x] Desktop: compute 70%-height 4:3 size in `lib.rs`

**Bug fixes (found during manual testing):**
- [x] Fix: CORS `allow_methods` missing `DELETE` — tab close silently failed in browser
- [x] Fix: Tauri capability `core:window:allow-set-title` missing — OS title did not update
- [x] Fix: Canvas freeze — canvas must reflect the active cached tab's snapshot, not live sidebar state
- [x] Fix: Reset sidebar + clear cache on new DXF import

**Performance improvements (pulled from Future/Unscheduled):**
- [x] Engine: NFP cache across sort strategies, copies, and grain modes (per-call dict, reverse-key trick)
- [x] Engine: parallel strategy execution via `ProcessPoolExecutor` with effort level 1–5
- [x] Engine: `/cancel-layout` terminates parallel workers immediately (`kill_current_executor`)
- [x] Frontend: Advanced sidebar — "Disable NFP cache" checkbox (dev/A-B toggle)
- [x] Frontend: Advanced sidebar — Parallel effort radio (1–5 levels)
- [x] Frontend: Configurable cache size input (5–20 entries)

**TEMP feature — internal name: "NFP temp switch":**
- [x] Engine + Frontend: `include_effort_in_key` flag — when enabled, the effort level is part of the cache dedup key so the same settings at different effort levels produce distinct entries; intended for benchmarking only. **Will be removed in a future PR** once parallel execution is validated.

**Reviewer follow-ups (all resolved):**
- [x] `GrainPanel.test.tsx` — vitest cases for Show grainline + single/bi radios
- [x] `BottomPanel` overflow branch — removed (unreachable from NFP-BLF math)
- [x] `useLayoutCache` on-mount `refresh()` — tabs restored after webview reload
- [x] Cache FIFO ordering — replaced `time.monotonic()` with internal monotonic integer `_sort_key` (avoids Windows 16 ms resolution ties)

### Phase 6 follow-ups — algorithm performance

- [x] Engine: branch pruning in serial `auto_layout_polygon` — abort strategies whose partial marker length already meets/exceeds the best complete result. Monotone-bound argument: BLF's partial marker length is non-decreasing in the number of placed pieces. Measured speedup 1.04x–1.65x on synthetic inputs and 1.18x on the sample_2.dxf × 10 real workload (190 pieces, bi grain). Shipped in PR #7.
- [x] Engine: parallel-path branch pruning via shared `multiprocessing.Value('d')` cutoff. Main process publishes completed-strategy results via `as_completed`; workers read per placement and self-abort once their partial >= shared cutoff. Result identical to serial mode. Measured wall-clock: sample_2.dxf × 10 (190 pieces, bi grain) drops from 25.7s (serial, pruning on) to 11.3s (parallel effort=5, pruning on) — 2.3x speedup from parallelism, plus pruning contributes ~10% within parallel mode (11.3s vs 12.5s no-prune). Also adds `disable_pruning: bool = False` toggle on `auto_layout_polygon` (mirrors `disable_nfp_cache`). Shipped in PR #8.
- [x] Engine: identical-piece pre-clustering MECHANISM (off by default; `disable_clustering: bool = True`). Groups copies by base id, packs into a rigid bbox super-piece, expands placements after BLF. Implementation correct (116 tests pass including grain-rotation feasibility, bi-grain expansion, oversized-group passthrough). **But bbox approximation regresses sample_2.dxf × 10 by +145%** (29958mm vs 12249mm at fabric=1651mm) because rigid super-pieces block fabric rows that BLF would otherwise interleave with other piece types. Shipped off; will be re-enabled (or replaced) once true-union polygon clusters land. PR #<n>.

### Phase 7 — Export
- [ ] Export layout as DXF or PNG (sourced from any cached layout tab)
- [ ] Export UI flow
- [ ] File output tests

### Phase 8 — Packaging and usability polish

## Future / Unscheduled

Items not yet assigned to a phase. Rough notes captured to avoid losing context.

### NFP temp switch — removal target

> Internal name: **NFP temp switch** (`include_effort_in_key` flag in engine + frontend).
> Benchmarking-only. Remove once parallel execution confidence is high (target: Phase 7 acceptance testing window).

- [ ] Remove `include_effort_in_key` from `POST /auto-layout` body parsing (`engine/api/main.py`)
- [ ] Remove `_bench_effort` tagging and matching in `LayoutCache.find_by_settings` (`engine/core/layout/cache.py`)
- [ ] Remove `includeEffortInKey` state + checkbox from `App.tsx` Advanced sidebar
- [ ] Remove `includeEffortInKey` param from `useAutoLayout.runAutoLayout`
- [ ] Remove `TEMP(phase6-bench)` comments throughout

### Branch-pruning follow-ups (filed when PR #7 shipped)

- [x] **Parallel-path pruning.** Workers in `ProcessPoolExecutor` don't share `best_so_far`. Options: `multiprocessing.Value` for an atomic shared cutoff (checked every N placements to amortize IPC), or tournament staging (run 2 scout strategies serially first, then dispatch the rest with the established cutoff). Defer until benchmarks justify the IPC cost on real workloads. (Shipped in PR #8.)
- [ ] **Smart strategy ordering.** Run the historically-best sort strategy first so the cutoff tightens sooner for the remaining runs. Needs telemetry on which sort wins most often (currently no data).
- [ ] **Cutoff slack.** Accept runs within `epsilon` of best for diversity (e.g., to keep "almost as good" results for future export/comparison). Not needed today; file here so it's not lost.

### Layout improvements — algorithm

> Filed after the sample_2.dxf × 10 commercial-vs-OpenMarker comparison (commercial: 10599 mm @ 86.1%; ours: 11699 mm @ 79.4% — ~7pp gap on the headline workload). Items ranked by gain-per-effort.

- [~] **Identical-piece pre-clustering (true-union polygon clusters).** Mechanism for grouping + expansion shipped in PR #<n> but with bbox approximation — that version regresses real garment workloads by +145% because rigid bbox super-pieces can't interleave with other piece types. Next attempt: cluster polygon = Shapely union of the packed copy polygons (with offsets), so inter-copy bays can host smaller pieces from other groups. NFP gets more complex (non-convex / multi-polygon clusters) but reclaims the regression. Medium-high effort. **Wait until basic mechanism is validated by a workload that DOES benefit from bbox clustering before adding union polygons.**

- [ ] **Grain-compatible mirroring.** When `grain_mode == "bi"`, allow horizontal reflection of pieces (flip x-coords within bbox center). Adds reflected copies to the rotation candidate set. Estimated gain: 1–3pp. Medium effort.

- [ ] **Concave-bay fill pass.** Post-pass after primary BLF: for each large piece with a concave bay (e.g., armhole curves on a garment piece), attempt to tuck small unplaced pieces into the bay region. Bays detected via polygon difference of bbox minus polygon. Estimated gain: 1–3pp on garment workloads. High effort — needs bay-detection geometry + a second placement pass.

- [ ] **GA / SA meta-heuristic wrapper.** Wrap the existing NFP-BLF as the fitness function inside a genetic or simulated-annealing search over piece-ordering permutations and per-piece rotation choices. Iterative — runs BLF many times with budget bounded by a time/iteration cap. Estimated gain: 3–8pp. High effort — adds an entire outer search loop; needs parallelization design to keep wall-clock reasonable. Combines naturally with the other items (they all become inner-loop primitives the meta-heuristic explores).

- [ ] **More sort strategies (8–12 instead of 4).** Add e.g. perimeter-DESC, diagonal-DESC, aspect-ratio-extremes-first, hilbert-curve ordering. Cheap to add (one named function each); benefits compose with parallel pruning. Estimated gain: 0.5–2pp. Low effort.
