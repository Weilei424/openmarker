# Backlog

## Status Legend
- [ ] Not started
- [x] Complete
- [~] In progress

---

### Phase 0 — Planning and repository setup
- [x] Finalize architecture
- [x] Set agent rules (CLAUDE.md, CODEX.md, SKILLS.md)
- [x] Create repository skeleton
- [x] Write ROADMAP.md
- [x] Write starter README.md

### Phase 1 — Desktop shell and local engine wiring
- [x] Bootstrap Tauri app shell
- [x] Open React UI inside desktop shell
- [x] Start Python FastAPI engine locally
- [x] Wire UI → engine ping (GET /ping)
- [x] Document local dev instructions

### Phase 2 — DXF import and normalization
- [x] POST /import-dxf endpoint
- [x] INSERT-based ET CAD DXF parser
- [x] Flat layer-scan fallback parser
- [x] Open segment chaining (_chain_open_segments)
- [x] Geometry normalization (translate to origin, make_valid)
- [x] Piece and BoundingBox dataclasses
- [x] Sample DXF fixtures (examples/input/)
- [x] Unit tests: parser + normalize
- [x] Integration test: API upload round-trip

### Phase 3 — Visual workspace
- [x] Konva Stage rendering piece polygons
- [x] Zoom and pan (useViewport)
- [x] Fit-to-content on import
- [x] Piece selection (click to select)
- [x] Fabric bounds overlay
- [x] Status bar (piece count, fabric width)
- [x] PieceList sidebar panel
- [x] FabricPanel (fabric width input)
- [ ] Viewport regression tests

### Phase 4 — Manual editing
- [ ] Drag pieces on canvas
- [ ] Rotate pieces (keyboard or handle)
- [ ] Snap behavior (optional)
- [ ] Collision highlight feedback
- [ ] Placement state model (piece id → x, y, rotation)
- [ ] Regression tests for drag/rotate transformations

### Phase 5 — Simple auto layout
- [ ] User inputs fabric width
- [ ] Run placement heuristic (strip packing or guillotine)
- [ ] Compute marker length
- [ ] Compute utilization percentage
- [ ] Show manual vs auto utilization comparison

### Phase 6 — Export
- [ ] Export layout as DXF or PNG
- [ ] Export UI flow
- [ ] File output tests

### Phase 7 — Packaging and usability polish
- [ ] Bundle engine as PyInstaller sidecar
- [ ] Build Windows installer (cargo tauri build)
- [ ] Generate app icons (scripts/gen-icons.py)
- [ ] Remove any remaining setup friction
- [ ] QA checklist for non-technical users
